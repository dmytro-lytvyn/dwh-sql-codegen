Codegen:
	Maybe keep a copy of the current record + batch info in history table for easier selecting?
	Implement history loads within one batch
	Move "Is Date Updated" closer?

Interface:
	Add a parameter to define the generated script name suffix (to allow several scripts for one table - full and incremental, for example)
	Implement toolbar instead of buttons, review menu
	Remove debug messages and review/cleanup the code
